# Visualize changes in class schedules from Zermelo

With the growing call to ban phones from schools an ancient, almost forgotten concept is on the rise again: a method 
to view today's changes on a screen. This project aims to provide a simple, secure and free way to show relevant 
information on screens. 

## Try a demo
The demo will be available very soon. (It was ready before I remembered not everyone has the same school ID, oops)
